	abstract = {Modern board games are a rich source of entertainment for many people, but also contain interesting and challenging structures for game playing research and implementing game playing agents. This paper studies the game Patchwork, a two player strategy game using polyomino tile drafting and placement. The core polyomino placement mechanic is implemented in a constraint model using regular constraints, extending and improving the model in (Lagerkvist, Pesant, 2008) with: explicit rotation handling; optional placements; and new constraints for resource usage. Crucial for implementing good game playing agents is to have great heuristics for guiding the search when faced with large branching factors. This paper divides placing tiles into two parts: a policy used for placing parts and an evaluation used to select among different placements. Policies are designed based on classical packing literature as well as common standard constraint programming heuristics. For evaluation, global propagation guided regret is introduced, choosing placements based on not ruling out later placements. Extensive evaluations are performed, showing the importance of using a good evaluation and that the proposed global propagation guided regret is a very effective guide.},

	abstract = {A unique behavior of humans is modifying one’s unobservable behavior based on the reaction of others for cooperation. We used a card game called Hanabi as an evaluation task of imitating human reflective intelligence with artificial intelligence. Hanabi is a cooperative card game with incomplete information. A player cooperates with an opponent in building several card sets constructed with the same color and ordered numbers. However, like a blind man's bluff, each player sees the cards of all other players except his/her own. Also, communication between players is restricted to information about the same numbers and colors, and the player is required to read his/his opponent's intention with the opponent's hand, estimate his/her cards with incomplete information, and play one of them for building a set. We compared human play with several simulated strategies. The results indicate that the strategy with feedbacks from simulated opponent's viewpoints achieves more score than other strategies.},

    📍 Why is it radical? I taught using a simple board game (at a time when video games are over-focused on in research). I show what the learning looks like (I include a photo). The teaching and learning didn’t occur in a laboratory setting, but in the wild (in a community center). I focused on the learning around games.

Creative captioning draws on core AI research areas of vision, natural language processing, narrative reasoning, and social reasoning, and across all these areas, it requires sophisticated uses of common sense and cultural knowledge. In this paper, we analyze several specific research problems that fall under creative captioning, using the popular board game Dixit as both inspiration and proposed testing ground. We expect that Dixit could serve as an engaging and motivating benchmark for creative captioning across numerous AI research communities for the coming 1-2 decades.},

Therefore, it is challenging to build AI agents by Reinforcement Learning (RL for short), without domain knowledge nor heuristics. In this paper, we introduce cross-dimensional neural networks to handle a mixture of information sources and a wide variety of outputs, and empirically demonstrate that the network dramatically improves RL in Catan. We also show that, for the first time, a RL agent can outperform jsettler, the best heuristic agent available.},

	abstract = {\&lt;p class=\&quot;abstract\&quot;\&gt;Hanabi is a multiplayer cooperative card game, where only your partners know your cards. All players succeed or fail together. This makes the game an excellent testbed for studying collaboration. Recently, it has been shown that deep neural networks can be trained through self-play to play the game very well. However, such agents generally do not play well with others. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of training Rainbow DQN agents with human-inspired rule-based agents. We analyze with which agents Rainbow agents learn to play well, and how well playing skill transfers to agents they were not trained with. We also analyze patterns of communication between agents to elucidate how collaboration happens. A key finding is that while most agents only learn to play well with partners seen during training, one particular agent leads the Rainbow algorithm towards a much more general policy. The metrics and hypotheses advanced in this paper can be used for further study of collaborative agents.\&lt;/p\&gt;},
